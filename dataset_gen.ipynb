    "# Dataset Enrichment for LLM Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook focuses on **enhancing raw textual data** before fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores **two dataset enrichment strategies**:\n",
    "1. POS-based linguistic enrichment\n",
    "2. LLM-based semantic enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "Although POS tagging provides syntactic structure, **it does not capture semantic context**.\n",
    "In practice, fine-tuning on POS-tagged data led to:\n",
    "- Severe hallucinations\n",
    "- Loss of contextual grounding\n",
    "- Overfitting to syntactic patterns instead of meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "✅ POS-based enrichment is used **only for analysis and experimentation**  \n",
    "❌ POS-enriched data is **NOT used** in the final fine-tuning dataset  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only **LLM-generated, context-rich samples** are saved and used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The enriched dataset is later used to fine-tune an LLM for high-quality article generation.\n"

    "- Linguistic analysis (POS tagging)\n",
    "- Local LLM inference\n",
    "- Dataset manipulation and storage\n",
